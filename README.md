# MLPerf™ Tiny v1.2 results

This is the repository containing results and code for the [v1.2 version of the MLPerf™ Tiny benchmark](https://github.com/mlcommons/tiny_results_v1.2). For final results please see [MLPerf™ Tiny v1.2 benchmark results](https://mlcommons.org/en/inference-tiny-12/).

For benchmark code and rules please see the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mlcommons/tiny).

Previous versions of the benchmark are available at the following pages.  To view the results table of a previous round, select that round from the Tabula viewer.

## MLPerf™ Tiny results directory structure

A submission is for one code base for the benchmarks submitted. An org may make multiple submissions. A submission should take the form of a directory with the following structure. The structure must be followed regardless of the actual location of the actual code, e.g. in the MLPerf repo or an external code host site.

In case of submission of results for multiple systems, please use <system_desc.id> to differentiate these. System names may be arbitrary. We recognize implementations for multiple systems of the same organization could have different dependencies on a common code base and on each other. When submitting the code, please organize the code as much as possible following a logical structure that makes it possible to reproduce the results, and accompany it with scripts and a README that explains the process. You can use multiple <implementation_id>s to structure your submission.

```

System names and implementation names may be arbitrary.

`<division>` must be one of {closed, open}.

`<benchmark>` must be one of {vww, ic, kws, ad}.
