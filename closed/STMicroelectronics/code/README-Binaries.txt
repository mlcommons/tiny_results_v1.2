Two binaries are avaiable for every Model/Platform combinaison.
They are located in the Binaries folders.

For example:

.\code\NUCLEO_H7A3ZI_Q\anomaly_detection\Binaries\AD01-Energy.bin
-> Binary file for NUCLEO_H7A3ZI, Anomaly detection compiled in Energy Mode

.\code\NUCLEO_H7A3ZI_Q\anomaly_detection\Binaries\AD01-Performance.bin
-> Binary for NUCLEO_H7A3ZI, Anomaly detection compiled in Performance Mode

Those Binaries can be flashed using CubeProgrammer, Erasing and Programming section.
Use start address : 0x08000000
